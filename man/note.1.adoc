== Description

pynote is a project to manage your notes on the commandline. It is written in
Python 3.5 and provides a very handy cmd-interface. Notes are managed as plain
text files, which are interfaced with (configurable) standard tools, for instance
`vi`, `vim`, `nvim` or `nano`. `note` provides an interface to these textfiles,
that means they can be listed as a table, or they can be read or removed easily.
Optionally, it is possible to enable git support enabling synchronization across
several machines easily.

== Options

`--no-pager`::
    Do not write any output to a pager, such as `less`

`--no-header`::
    Do not show the note's header

`--tmpfile`::
    Do not edit notes in place

`--style` STYLE::
    Explicitely set the table style

`--version`::
    Show the version and exit

`--debug`::
    Show additional debug information

== Commands

=== list

This prints out a table with all stores notes. This is the default command if
you pass nothing to `note`. The columns are sorted by the mtime of the unterlying
files:

----
$ note list
ID  Title         Updated
--  -----------   ------------
0   spam          seconds ago
1   lovely spam   1 day ago
----

`list` is the default subcommand, thus it can be omitted.

=== show

Shows a specific note including a header with some metadata. The numeric
ID has to be passed to `show`, e.g. `$ note show 0`. It is also possible
to use a slugified string:

----
$ note show 0
...

$ note show spam
spam @ 2014-05-31 17:19, 48 seconds ago

Spam, Spam, Spam, lovely Spam
Wonderful Spam, Lovely Spam.
Spam, Spam, Spam, magnificent Spam,
Superlative Spam.
Spam, Spam, Spam, wonderous Spam,
Surgical Spam, splendiferous Spam.
Spam, Spam, Spam, Spaaam!
----

`-w` CHARS::
    Wrap output at CHARS characters. This may be useful for reading a badly
    formatted note on the terminal.

=== all

Just prints out all notes.

=== add

The configured editor (e.g. `nvim`) opens and the content of choice can be
inserted. The title of the note has to be specified for `add`:

----
$ note add "wonderful spam"
----

=== edit

Edit a given note. Similar to `show` the numeric or the slugified title has to
be suplied. The configured editor is spawned with the content of the note of 
choice.

=== rm

Removes a note.

=== conf

Show all configuration values for debugging reasons:

----
$ note conf
----------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
globalconf              /etc/xdg/noterc
localconf               /home/stefan/.config/note/noterc

ui.dateformat           YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
ui.reldates             True
ui.style                simple
aliases                 {'all': '', 'git': '', 'edit': '', 'list': ['l'], 'add': '', 'show': ['s'], 'rm': ''}
