== pynote 2.1.0 (2016-06-14)

This is a feature release that brings two new commands -- `grep` and `find`.
The configuration has been changed slightly; there are minor breaking changes
but nothing really serious. Please change your `noterc(5)` accordingly in the
case you are affected.

* The configuration value `data.ignore_extensions` changed to a less verbose
  `data.ignore`.
* New defaults for some configuration values: `ui.reldates=yes`, `git.enabled=yes`, 
  `data.ignore=GIT`.
* Support for `git ls-files`. When `data.ignore` is set to `GIT` pynote uses
  `git ls-files` to generate the notes table; A potentially existing 
  `.gitignore` file is respected.
* New command `grep`. It can be used to search pattern in the notes. A 
  configurable backend is used for grepping; the default is `grep -r`.
  Fancy and cool backends are: `ag`, `ack`, `pt`, `git-grep`
* New command `filter`. Can be used to filter the notes table using 
  `fnmatch` patterns, for instance `note filter "private*"`.
* Improve automatically generated commit messages for git.
* Subcommands `show`, `edit` and `rm` can read multiple, space separated IDs now,
  for instance: `note show 1 2 3`.

== pynote 2.0.0 (2016-05-31)

* Complete rewrite of pynote. Everything has been restructured and merged into
  one Python file. Pynote 2.0 will be a new starting point, since I don't want
  to maintain the mess any more that I have created two years ago.
* Drop babel and replace it with https://arrow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[`arrow`].
  There is a 70 to 80 percent speedup when using reldates!
* Drop `click`; the `click` library is a mess. The decorator based CLI generation
  transforms the code into an unreadable, gigantic mess and I am no longer
  interested in reading through kilometers of spaghetti. The CLI generation has
  been switched back to stdlib `argparse`.
* Drop `plaintable` in favour of `tabulate` for generating tables. This library
  enables a few more styles out of the box.
* Discard sphinx and provide `asciidoctor` generated manpages instead. The legacy
  implementation `asciidoc` should work as well, though it is not tested.
* Dropped tags support; the json based concept was a broken. I am willing
  to reimplement tags, but I have to come up with a better solution first.
* Dropped pygments; there is now `c(1)`. One could pipe the output into `c(1)`
  in order to utilize syntax highlighting.
* Aliases Support. Aliases for subcommands can now be configured in `noterc(5)`.
* Git Support! Git support can be enabled; once a note has been changed by
  `note(1)` it is automatically commited to git.
* There is some refactoring and cleanup in `noterc(5)`, check the manpage and
  adjust it appropriately. It is not that large... :)
* Since the documentation is now written in the `asciidoc` markup language, the
  documentation now readable on github as well. Prerendered HTML files with
  `asciidoctor(1)` are available at https://docs.sevenbyte.org/pynote. It is
  updated by a cron job once an hour.

== pynote 1.1 (never released)

* Added a --tags argument to `note new`. You'll be able to assign tags
  to recently created notes.

== pynote 1.0 (2014-09-12)

=== Overall Changes

* Added a `conf` command to show the whole configuration for debugging
  reasons.
* Proper tag support.
* Removed "revision control" for now. Some day pynote will use git to handle
  revisions.
* Added support for XDG Base Directory Specification.
* Converted pygments to an optional dependency.
* `--no-header` now is a global command line option.
* **Big data storage refactoring!** JSON files are no longer used for storing
  data. Simple plain text files do the job much better. I have created a Gist
  on Github to migrate your data to the new format. Please refer to the
  :doc:`faq` for migrating.
* Pynote now accepts command abbreviations such as `note l` for `note
  list`. This mechanism is handled by click and works for every command so
  long as the short command is unique.
* Automatically pass the output through a pager when the output string is
  longer as the terminal height. This could be suppressed with `--no-pager`.
* Migrated the cl interface to the click_ library.
* First read global config, then read local config. The local noterc overrides
  settings in the global one.
* The editor value in your noterc now accepts command line arguments.
* I replaced prettytable with my own - much simpler - library plaintable_.
* Dropped python 3.3 support. I love the new pathlib module!
* Use relative dates with babel. You have to enable it in your configfile with
  reldates.
* The numeric note ids are now orderd from 0 to n.
* Removed translation things (for now). If anybody needs this we can create a
  transifex account to involve other people.
* New header design, thanks to Philipp GÃ¶ttlich!
* Removed **note init** command, pynote will do these things automatically.
* Do not include any precompiled files in git. For arch linux there is an AUR
  package for the html documentation and man pages.
* Missing import statement. Now you are informed about a misspelled pygments
  theme instead of a traceback.

=== Configuration Changes

Checkout :doc:`configuration`!

* **New value**: color
* **New value**: reldates

* **New value**: trash_path
* Refactored `config.py` to use default values and sections.

I switched pynote to https://pynote.readthedocs.org/ for hosting documentation
and I switched to github issues as well. There are no reasons to maintain my own
setup. Every issue ID below this entry is obsolete and refers to my old redmine
tracker.

== pynote 0.2.2 (2014-02-05)

Fixed some problems which especially occured since the last release.

* Fixed a wrong method call, see #370. Thanks to Klaus Seistrup.
* Fixed a problems with `pynote.init` and `pynote.config`, see #368 and
  forum posts. Thanks to tonk and null.
* Improved `pynote.container`. If no data files exist exit and print an error
  message.
* Got rid of git flow, see #369. The errors occured because I forgot to bump
  the version number. Git flow restricted me fixing this trivial error with a
  little rebase.
