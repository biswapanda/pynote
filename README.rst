pynote
======

pynote is a project to manage your notes on the commandline. It is written in
Python 3 and provides a very handy cmd-interface. You can browse the source
code on github_. If something does not behave as expected please file a bug in
github, write an email_ or check out the `support thread`_ in the arch linux
forums.

Documentation is hosted on `Read the Docs`_.

Install
-------

In Arch Linux you can use the PKGBUILDs in the AUR. There is a git_ and a
stable_ version. Otherwise use::

    $ pip install pynote

.. _git: https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/pynote-git/
.. _stable: https://aur.archlinux.org/pkgbase/pynote/


Install from source
-------------------

Clone the project with::

    $ git clone https://github.com/rumpelsepp/pynote.git

Install pynote with::

    # python setup.py install

As mentioned before pynote is written in python 3. As I use the pathlib module
there is **at least python 3.4 required**. Maybe there are backports of pathlib
to python 3.3 or below but I have not tested them. If you did so please let me
know.


Quickstart
----------

For initialization just run any command and pynote will tell you what to do::

    $ note new "spam"
    Error: The directory /home/stefan/.note does not exist!
    You can create it with "mkdir /home/stefan/.note".

    $ mkdir /home/stefan/.note

    $ note new "spam"
    Error: The directory /home/stefan/.note/.trash does not exist!
    You can create it with "mkdir /home/stefan/.note/.trash".

    $ mkdir /home/stefan/.note/.trash

    $ note new "spam"
    Info: New note 'spam' created!
